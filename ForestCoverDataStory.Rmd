## Data Overview
The forest cover data has a row for each sample representing a 30 meter by 30 meter square area
of land. Each cell sample is described by elevation, slope and direction the cell faces,
distance to water, roads, and fire and binary columns for wilderness area and soil type.
One of 4 possible wilderness areas and one of 40 possible aggregated soil types are
set in each row. The predicted variable is the coverage type indicating 1 of 7 possible
trees found in the cell sample.

As part of data cleaning, the aggregated soil type was split into it's individual components
of one possible climate zone, one possible geologic zone, one or more soil families and 
one or more "rocky-ness" categories. I hope to learn if breaking out the aggregated
soil type into its components will improve the effectiveness of predicting the coverage type.

The data is described in detail here: 
<https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/covtype/covtype.info>.
The data names have been abbreviated but can be related to the data descriptions easily.

```{r "Create Alt Forest Data Frame"}
#glimpse(forestcover)

# An Alternate Forest Cover data frame is created for Shapiro statistics testing for whether data follows
# a normal distribution. The Shapiro test has a maximum of 5000 data points. The Forestcover data frame 
# is sampled to ensure the maximum is not exceeded.

if(nrow(forestcover)> 5000) {
  samplefactor <- as.integer(nrow(forestcover)/4500)
  if (samplefactor < 2) { samplefactor <- 2 }
  altforestcover<-forestcover[seq(1, nrow(forestcover), samplefactor), ]
} else {
  altforestcover<-forestcover
}
```
## List Selected Data Ranges
Data ranges are listed to help validate the data is within expected limits.
```{r}
myranges <- function(name,x) { c(name, min = min(x), mean = mean(x), median=median(x), max = max(x),
                                 nonzero=sum(x!=0)) }

forestDataRanges <- data.frame("Data"=character(), "min"=double(), "mean"=double(),
                               "median"=double(), "max"=double(), "nonzero"=integer(),
                               stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
forestDataRanges[nrow(forestDataRanges)+1,] <- myranges("Elev",forestcover$Elev)
forestDataRanges[nrow(forestDataRanges)+1,] <- myranges("Elev",forestcover$ElevSlot)
forestDataRanges[nrow(forestDataRanges)+1,] <- myranges("Aspect",forestcover$Aspect)
forestDataRanges[nrow(forestDataRanges)+1,] <- myranges("Slope",forestcover$Slope)
forestDataRanges[nrow(forestDataRanges)+1,] <- myranges("H2OHD",forestcover$H2OHD)
forestDataRanges[nrow(forestDataRanges)+1,] <- myranges("H2OVD",forestcover$H2OVD)
forestDataRanges[nrow(forestDataRanges)+1,] <- myranges("RoadHD",forestcover$RoadHD)
forestDataRanges[nrow(forestDataRanges)+1,] <- myranges("FirePtHD",forestcover$FirePtHD)
forestDataRanges[nrow(forestDataRanges)+1,] <- myranges("Shade9AM",forestcover$Shade9AM)
forestDataRanges[nrow(forestDataRanges)+1,] <- myranges("Shade12P",forestcover$Shade12PM)
forestDataRanges[nrow(forestDataRanges)+1,] <- myranges("Shade3PM",forestcover$Shade3PM)
forestDataRanges[nrow(forestDataRanges)+1,] <- myranges("RWwild",forestcover$RWwild)
forestDataRanges[nrow(forestDataRanges)+1,] <- myranges("NEwild",forestcover$NEwild)
forestDataRanges[nrow(forestDataRanges)+1,] <- myranges("CMwild",forestcover$CMwild)
forestDataRanges[nrow(forestDataRanges)+1,] <- myranges("CPwild",forestcover$CPwild)
forestDataRanges

```

The results show all the data values have reasonable values and there is no missing data. 
The elevation ranges from 1859 meters (6099 feet) to 3858 meters (12657 feet). These are valid ranges for elevation in the Colorado wilderness 
areas being sampled, but the rule of thumb for timberline (the maximum elevation for where trees
are found) is 11500 feet. It might be interesting to see how accurate predictions are if
samples above 11800 feet are removed.

ElevSlot, "Elevation Slot" is a new column that creates bins for elevation data for use with Chi-square testing. It is calculated by diving the elevation by 100 and truncating the value by saving as an integer. This results in 21 elevation bins.

The Aspect which is the compass heading that the terrain faces, ranges from 0 to 360 degrees and is a valid data range. The Slope is the steepness of the terrain with 0 degrees being flat and 90 degrees being vertical. The maximum Slope was found to be 66 degrees which seems logical since trees are not
usually seen on near-vertical cliffs. (It's a different story in New Zealand!)

The horizontal distance to the nearest water features, range from 0 to 1397 meters which seems reasonable. The vertical distance to nearest water features, range from -173 to 601 meters which seems reasonable and
can be negative since the nearest water may be below the forest cover data sample.

The horizontal distance to the nearest road ranges from 0 to 7117 meters which is reasonable.
The horizontal distance to the nearest fire features range from 0 to 7173 meters which is reasonable.
The amount of shade present in a cell sample at 9AM, 12PM and 3PM ranges from 0 (full sun) to 254
(fully shaded). 

A table showing the number of occurrences for each tree type is shown below.
```{r}

covCount<-data.frame(table(forestcover$CovName))
totCount<-nrow(forestcover)
covCount <- mutate(covCount,Percent = as.integer(covCount$Freq*1000/totCount)/10)
LodgePct<-covCount$Percent[covCount$Var1=="Lodgepole"]
SpruceFirPct<-covCount$Percent[covCount$Var1=="Spruce&Fir"]
LodgeAndSpruceFir<-LodgePct+SpruceFirPct
#```
#```{r echo=TRUE}
covCount
```

Lodge pole Pine represents `r LodgePct` percent of the sample.
So always guessing "Lodge pole" would provide success rate of `r LodgePct` percent
and can be used as a baseline for comparing our predictions. Spruce and Fir represent the next 
largest number of trees. The two together represent `r LodgeAndSpruceFir` percent.

### Elevation Histogram

```{r "Figure 4"}
  g <- ggplot(forestcover,aes(Elev)) +
       geom_histogram(bins=40) +
       labs(title = 'Elevation Histogram',
             # subtitle = 'All Data',
              x="Elevation Bins (meters)", y="Count") 
         # theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=-90))
  x<-ggsave("Fig-Elev-Histogram.jpg")
```  

![Elevation Histogram](Fig-Elev-Histogram.jpg)

A good histogram for elevation is generated Using 40 bins. There are two humps in the histogram and there may be a more complicated distribution. The elevation may be related to other variables. Next the elevation is grouped by coverage type and wilderness to see how elevation relates to coverage type.

### Elevation Density
```{r "Figure 7",echo=FALSE}

  g <- ggplot(forestcover,aes(Elev, CovName)) +
       geom_density_ridges(scale = 3, rel_min_height = 0.01) +
       scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.01, 0)) +
       scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0.01, 0)) +
       labs(title = 'Elevation Relative Density',
       #subtitle = 'by Coverage Type', 
              x="Elevation (meters)") + # , y="Coverage Type") +
       theme_ridges(font_size = 13, grid = T) + theme(axis.title.y = element_blank())
      
  x<-ggsave("Fig-Elev-Density-CovType-Offset.jpg")
```  

![Elevation Density by Coverage Type](Fig-Elev-Density-CovType-Offset.jpg)

The density ridges geom gives a good feel for the ranges of elevation for each coverage type.
It looks like the elevation is a significant factor in helping determine coverage type.

### Coverage vs Climate Frequency 

```{r "Figure 28",message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
workdata<-data.frame(table(forestcover$ClimateName,forestcover$CovName))
workcols<-colnames(workdata)
workcols[1]<-"Climate"
workcols[2]<-"Coverage"
workcols[3]<-"Frequency"
colnames(workdata)<-workcols

jpeg(filename="Fig-Cover-Vs-Climate-Freq-3D.jpg")
cloud(Frequency~Coverage+Climate, workdata, panel.3d.cloud=panel.3dbars, col.facet='grey', 
      xbase=0.5, ybase=0.5, scales=list(arrows=FALSE, col=1), 
      main="Coverage vs Climate Frequency Chart",
      par.settings = list(axis.line = list(col = "transparent")))
dev.off()
```

![Coverage vs Climate Frequency](Fig-Cover-Vs-Climate-Freq-3D.jpg)

This gives a good view of the potential challenge to determine the various coverage types.
The Lodge pole and Spruce & Fir trees make up the largest portion of the tree types.
Determining the other tree types looks like they are in the "noise" of the data
and might be more difficult to determine.

### Geologic Zone vs Climate with Tree Type

```{r "Figure 35"}

  g <- ggplot(forestcover,aes(ClimateName,GeoName, col=CovName)) +
        geom_jitter(alpha=alphaVal) +
        labs(title="Geologic Zone vs Climate by Tree Type",
            x = "Climate Zone",
            y = "Geologic Zone") +
       theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=-90))
  x<-ggsave("Fig-Geo-vs-Climate-by-TreeType.jpg")
```  

![Geologic Zone vs Climate with Tree Type](Fig-Geo-vs-Climate-by-TreeType.jpg)

Looking at the coverage type vs Climate and Geologic zones shows the two combinations
may be helpful in determine coverage type but it is difficult to determine from this graph.
The jitter geom was used to try to show the density, but the color coding
is not distinct enough to get a feeling of the relative density of the tree coverage.


### Aspect Relative Density vs Tree Type

```{r "Figure 25"}

  g <- ggplot(forestcover,aes(Aspect, CovName)) +
       geom_density_ridges(scale = 3, rel_min_height = 0.01) +
       scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.01, 0)) +
       scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0.01, 0)) +
       labs(title = 'Aspect Relative Density by Coverage Type', 
            x="Aspect (degrees)"
            # , y="Coverage Type"
       ) +
       theme_ridges(font_size = 13, grid = T) + theme(axis.title.y = element_blank())
      
  x<-ggsave("Fig-Aspect-Density-CovType-Offset.jpg")
```  

![Aspect Density by Coverage Type](Fig-Aspect-Density-CovType-Offset.jpg)

Many other data were examined but did not suggest as clear a relationship to coverage type as 
the previous graphs.
For example, the aspect of the slope (direction the slope of the cell faces) 
looks similar for each tree type.
There are concentrations of tree types near aspects of 100 and 360 degrees.
This occurs for all tree types and shows that the aspect will probably not be a significant factor
in determining coverage type.


## Statistics Analysis

After looking at some of the data relationships graphically, some statistical tests are applied to
the data to test if variables follow a normal distribution or are independent.

### Shaprio Test - Elevation

The Elevation histogram looks like it possibly has a normal distribution. It is not perfect
but might be close enough statistically. 

The Shapiro test is used to determine if data is normally distributed. 
The maximum number of data points for this Shaprio test is 5000. A sample of the forest cover
data set was extracted for the Shapiro test.
The Shapiro test result is shown below.

```{r "Shapiro Elev",echo=TRUE}
shapiro.test(altforestcover$Elev)

```
The null hypothesis for the Shapiro test is that the data follows a normal distribution. 
If the P-value is less than the 0.05 significance level, the null hypothesis is rejected
and the data is not considered to be normally distributed otherwise the data is normally
distributed.

The P-value for elevation data is 2e-16 which is nearly zero and much less than 0.05, therefore the
null hypothesis is rejected and the data is not normally distributed. 
The previous histogram shows this visually: The graph has a long left tail and
a short right tail.

### Chi Square Test - Elevation & Coverage Name

It looks like elevation can be used to help identify coverage type. A chi-square test will be
used to see if the coverage type and elevation variables are independent.

```{r chisq}

# To help with analysis, a function to calculate expected values for a contingency table 
# is created as shown next.

# Create a table of expected values from a contigency table
expValues <- function(dFrame,debug) { 
  wFrame<-dFrame             # create a new data frame with the same dimensions as passed in
  cstcsums<-colSums(wFrame)  # get a total count for each row
  cstrsums<-rowSums(wFrame)  # get a total count for each column
  csumTot<-sum(cstcsums)     # get a total count of all data points
  
  if (debug) {               # display the column and row counts if requested
    print(paste("colsums=",cstcsums))
    print(paste("rowsums=",cstrsums))
    print(paste("Total Count",csumTot))
  }
  
  # calculate the expected value for each cell
  minErr<-0                             # keep track of any errors (min expected value is 5 for chi-sqr)
  for(i in 1:nrow(wFrame)) {
    for(j in 1:ncol(wFrame)) {
      expval<-as.integer(cstrsums[i]*10*cstcsums[j]/csumTot)/10  # truncate expected value to 0.1
      if(expval<5) {
        if(debug) {
          print(paste("Warn: Cell[",i,",",j,"]=",expval," is less than 5!"))
        }
        minErr<-minErr+1
      }
      wFrame[i,j]<-expval     # save the expected value in the table
    }
  }
  if (minErr > 0) {
    print(paste("WARNING! There were",minErr,"cells with expected values less than 5."))
  }
  wFrame  # return the table
}
```


```{r}

#Now, create a contigency table for Coverage Type vs Elevation Bin, print the table and check 
#that the sum of the counts add up to the number of rows in the forest coverage data.


#chisqtbl<-table(forestcover$CovName, forestcover$ElevSlot)
#chisqtbl
#sum(colSums(chisqtbl))
#Create an expected values table. We want to ensure that the minimum expected value
#for each cell is at least 5, otherwise the chi-square test is not valid.

#expVals<-expValues(chisqtbl,1)
#expVals
#sum(colSums(expVals))
cst <- chisq.test(table(forestcover$CovName, forestcover$ElevSlot), correct = FALSE)
cst

```  

If the P-value is less than significance factor of 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected and the 
variables are not independent. The P-value is 2e-16 which is nearly zero. This shows that the
coverage type and elevation are dependent, if the chi-square test is valid.

### Coverage Type vs Soil Type Independence check

The original paper used the Soil Type categories to predict coverage type. Let's try 
a chi-square test on them. 

```{r "Chi-square Soil Type"}
#chisqtbl<-table(forestcover$CovName, forestcover$SoilType)
#chisqtbl
#sum(colSums(chisqtbl))

#Next an expected value table is created to verify that all expected values are at least 5.

#expVals<-expValues(chisqtbl,1)
#expVals
#sum(colSums(expVals))

#Here we see there are several cells with expected values less than 5. The chi-square test may not be
#valid and the chi-square test itself (below) says the test may not be valid. Although we don't know if
#expected counts less than 5 is the reason for the message.

```


```{r}
cst <- chisq.test(table(forestcover$CovName, forestcover$SoilType), correct = FALSE)
cst

```  

If the P-value is less than significance factor of 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected and the 
variables are not independent. The P-value is 2e-16 which is nearly zero. This shows that the
coverage type and soil type are dependent, if the chi-square test is valid.

### Chi Square Test - Climate & Coverage Name Independence Test

The climate vs coverage type frequency graphs looked like there was a relationship between the two.
A chi-square test on climate and coverage name is shown below.

```{r "Chi-square Climate"}
#chisqtbl<-table(forestcover$CovName, forestcover$ClimateName)
#chisqtbl
#sum(colSums(chisqtbl))

#Next an expected value table is created to verify that all expected values are at least 5.

#expVals<-expValues(chisqtbl,1)
#expVals
#sum(colSums(expVals))


#Here we see there are several cells with expected values less than 5. The chi-square test may not be 
#valid and the chi-square test itself (below) says the test may not be valid. Although we don't know if 
#expected counts less than 5 is the reason for the message.

cst <- chisq.test(table(forestcover$CovName, forestcover$ClimateName), correct = FALSE)
cst

```  

If the P-value is less than significance factor of 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected and the 
variables are not independent. The P-value is 2e-16 which is nearly zero. This shows that the
climate zone and coverage type are dependent, if the chi-square test is valid.


## Conclusion

There are many interesting data distributions in the continuous data. The elevation data seems to be
the most easy to intuitively see a relationship predicting the outcome of the coverage type.

The other categorical data seems difficult to relate to outcome intuitively. 

Statistically, chi-square testing indicates that both elevation and soil type are 
related to the coverage type. 

It will be interesting to see how the machine learning algorithms find relationships with
the different data and if splitting out the soil type into individual components
improves the accuracy of the predicted tree type.
